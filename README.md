# Analysis-of-Sales-Data
In this project, I used Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data.
The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.
